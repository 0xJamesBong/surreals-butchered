This is a smart contract of NFTs representing a Zermelo construction of the Naturals.

The Naturals are represented as strings of curly brackets. 

``` 
    0 = {} = emptyset
    1 = {0} = {{}}
    2 = {1} = {{{}}}
```
And so on. 

This is slightly different from the more familiar Zermelo / Von Neuman Ordinal construction of the Naturals where 
``` 
    0 = {} = emptyset
    1 = {0} = {emptyset}
    2 = {0,1} = {{}, {{}}}
```
It doesn't really matter as the two constructions are isomorphic.
